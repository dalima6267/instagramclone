# InstagramClone
An Instagram clone is a social media app that mimics Instagram’s core features, allowing users to share photos and videos, follow friends, like and comment on posts, and explore trending content. It includes a user authentication system, a profile section, a news feed, and real-time notifications. The app can be built using Firebase for backend services, Kotlin for Android development, and RecyclerView for displaying posts. Additional features like stories, direct messaging, and reels can be added to enhance user engagement. This project is great for learning app development, UI/UX design, and backend integration.
